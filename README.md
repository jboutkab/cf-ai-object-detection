# CF Workers AI Object Detection with Slack Notifications

This project is inspired by [Elizabeth Siegle's CF Workers AI Object Detection Webcam](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cf-workers-ai-obj-detection-webcam). It enables AI-based object detection with integration for Slack notifications. Below are the steps to set up and run the project using Wrangler.

---

## Setup Instructions

### **1. Wrangler Configuration Update**
1. Rename `wrangler.toml.rename` to `wrangler.toml`:
   ```bash
   mv wrangler.toml.rename wrangler.toml
   ```
2. Create a KV namespace for storing data:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler kv namespace create TECHRADAR_DETECTION_KV_NAMESPACE
   ```
   - Note the **KV namespace name** and **ID** generated by this command.
3. Update `wrangler.toml`:
   - Replace the placeholders for the KV namespace name and ID with the values generated in the previous step.
4. Add your Slack Webhook URL to `wrangler.toml` for notifications.

## Installation and Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

1. Deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the Cloudflare Workers CLI (`wrangler`) installed and properly authenticated before starting.
- The Slack Webhook URL is required for sending notifications from the Worker. Make sure it's properly configured in `wrangler.toml`.
