CF Workers AI Object Detection with Slack Notifications

This project is inspired by Elizabeth Siegle's CF Workers AI Object Detection Webcam. It enables AI-based object detection with integration for Slack notifications. Below are the steps to set up and run the project using Wrangler.

Setup Instructions

1. Wrangler Configuration Update

Rename wrangler.toml.rename to wrangler.toml:

mv wrangler.toml.rename wrangler.toml

Create a KV namespace for storing data:

npx wrangler kv namespace create TECHRADAR_DETECTION_KV_NAMESPACE

Note the KV namespace name and ID generated by this command.

Update wrangler.toml:

Replace the placeholders for the KV namespace name and ID with the values generated in the previous step.

Add your Slack Webhook URL to wrangler.toml for notifications.

Installation and Development

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

Deployment

Deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers:

npm run deploy

Notes

Ensure that you have the Cloudflare Workers CLI (wrangler) installed and properly authenticated before starting.

The Slack Webhook URL is required for sending notifications from the Worker. Make sure it's properly configured in wrangler.toml.
